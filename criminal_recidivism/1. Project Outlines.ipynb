    "Recidivism is the act of a person repeating an undesirable behavior after they have either experienced negative consequences of that behavior, or have been trained to extinguish that behavior. It is also used to refer to the percentage of former prisoners who are rearrested for a similar offense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Department of Corrections uses recidivism as an indicator on whether strategies are reducing offenders relapse into criminal behavior. A three year time frame is used as studies have shown if an offender relapses into criminal behavior it is most likely to happen within three years of being released.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 3 years of rehabilitation, can we predict whether an individual offender will go on to reoffend, break the terms of their parole, or never offend again? In this project, I aim to create an accurate, reliable classification model to predict the outcome of 3 years of rehabilitation on inmates from an Iowa correctional facility.\n",

    "It outlines, for 26,020 inmates at a correctional facility in Iowa,  whether an offender is re-admitted to prison or not within three years from being released from prison in Iowa. It records. for each inmate, whether they went on to commit another offence (Recidivism Type 'New'), broke the terms of their violation (Recidivism Type 'Tech', standing for Technical Violation), or never returned to prison (Recidivism Type 'No Recidivism'). It also contains a lot of information on the background of each of these prisoners which could make for an interesting set of features, including their ethnicity, their initial offense classification and type, and the time it took for them to return to prison (in days).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another data set I found, from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/recidivism-beginning-2008, outlines recidivism for 120,000 prisoners in a similar way- however, it only contains information about their location, sex and age, and will not make for as interesting modelling."

IN the case of Under 25 and Over 55, I will be using 25 and 55 as an age marker respectively.\n",
